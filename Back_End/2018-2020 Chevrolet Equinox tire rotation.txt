2018-2020 Chevrolet Equinox
Preparation

Park on a flat surface, engage the parking brake, and use a lug wrench to loosen all lug nuts slightly.
Lift the Vehicle

Use a floor jack to lift one side of the Equinox, placing jack stands beneath the frame for added safety. Repeat on the other side.
Remove Tires

Remove the lug nuts and take off the wheels.
Rotation Pattern

For front-wheel drive (FWD): Move the front tires straight to the rear. The rear tires should cross to the front (rear left to front right, rear right to front left).
Reinstall the Tires

Hand-tighten the lug nuts before lowering the car.
Lower and Torque

Lower the vehicle and tighten the lug nuts to 140 ft-lbs using a torque wrench.
Final Check

After a short test drive, recheck the lug nut torque to ensure everything is secure.
