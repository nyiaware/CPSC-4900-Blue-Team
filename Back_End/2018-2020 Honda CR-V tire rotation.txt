2018-2020 Honda CR-V
Preparation

Park on a flat, stable surface and engage the parking brake. Loosen the lug nuts slightly before lifting the vehicle.
Jack Up the SUV

Use a jack to lift the front end first, securing it with jack stands. Repeat for the rear of the vehicle.
Remove Tires

Unscrew the lug nuts completely and remove the wheels.

Reinstall Tires

Place the wheels on their new hubs and hand-tighten the lug nuts.
Lower and Torque

Lower the vehicle and tighten the lug nuts to the specified 80 ft-lbs.
Final Test

Inspect tire condition and pressure, then test drive the CR-V to ensure proper installation.
