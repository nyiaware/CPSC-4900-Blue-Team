2018-2020 Toyota Highlander
Preparation

Park the SUV on level ground. Engage the parking brake and loosen lug nuts on all wheels.
Lift the SUV

Use a jack to lift the front first, placing jack stands securely under the frame. Repeat for the rear.
Remove Wheels

Remove the lug nuts completely and take off all four wheels.
Rotation Pattern

For all-wheel drive (AWD): Use an "X-pattern" rotation (front left to rear right, front right to rear left, and rear tires straight to the front).
Reinstall Tires

Place the wheels on the hubs in their new positions. Hand-tighten the lug nuts.
Lower and Torque

Lower the SUV and tighten the lug nuts to the specified 83 ft-lbs using a torque wrench.
Final Test

Check for proper installation with a short drive and re-torque the lug nuts if necessary.
