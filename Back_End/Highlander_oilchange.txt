Oil Change Guide for a 2018-2020 Toyota Highlander
Tools and Supplies:
Oil (usually 0W-20 for a 2018-2020 Highlander)
New oil filter
Oil filter wrench
Wrench for drain plug
Drain pan
Funnel
Gloves and rags
Instructions:
Prepare the Vehicle:

Warm up the engine for a few minutes to allow the oil to flow more easily. Park on a flat surface and set the parking brake.
Raise the Vehicle:

Use a jack and jack stands to lift the front, giving you clear access underneath.
Drain the Oil:

Position the drain pan under the oil drain plug, then use a wrench to remove the plug.
Let the oil drain completely, then reattach and tighten the drain plug securely.
Remove and Replace the Oil Filter:

Find the oil filter under the engine (some models may have it on the side or bottom).
Remove it with an oil filter wrench, then apply a light coat of fresh oil on the seal of the new filter.
Screw on the new filter by hand, ensuring itâ€™s snug but not too tight.
Refill with New Oil:

Open the oil filler cap and use a funnel to add the recommended amount of new oil.
Replace the filler cap and check for any visible leaks.
Check Oil Level and Test:

After starting the engine briefly and letting it sit, use the dipstick to verify the oil level.
Add more oil if necessary to reach the correct level.
Dispose of Used Oil:

Bring the used oil and filter to an authorized recycling location.
