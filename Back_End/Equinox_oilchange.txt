Step-by-Step for Oil Change
2018-2020 Chevrolet Equinox

Tools Needed:

Oil filter wrench, drain pan, 15 mm socket wrench, funnel, gloves, new oil filter, and 5 quarts of 5W-30 synthetic oil.
Prepare the Vehicle

Park on a flat surface and allow the engine to cool completely.
Lift the Vehicle

Use a jack and jack stands to raise the front of the Equinox.
Locate the Drain Plug

The drain plug is under the oil pan, near the center of the vehicle.
Drain the Oil

Place the drain pan under the plug, loosen it with a 15 mm socket wrench, and let the oil drain fully.
Replace the Oil Filter

The oil filter is accessible from the bottom. Unscrew it, apply oil to the gasket of the new filter, and install it hand-tight.
Reinstall the Drain Plug

Tighten the drain plug securely with the socket wrench.
Add New Oil

Use the funnel to pour in the oil. Check the dipstick to ensure proper levels.
Final Check

Start the engine and look for leaks. Dispose of the used oil responsibly.
