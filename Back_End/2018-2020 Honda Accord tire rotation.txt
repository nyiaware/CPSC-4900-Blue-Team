Preparation

Park on a flat surface, engage the parking brake, and slightly loosen the lug nuts on all four wheels with a lug wrench.
Lift the Vehicle

Jack up the front of the vehicle and place jack stands under the designated lift points. Repeat the process for the rear.
Remove Tires

Fully unscrew the lug nuts and remove all four wheels.
Rotation Pattern

For front-wheel drive (FWD): Move the front tires straight to the rear. Cross the rear tires to the front (rear left to front right, rear right to front left).
Reinstall Tires

Mount the wheels in their new positions and tighten the lug nuts by hand.
Lower and Torque

Lower the car and use a torque wrench to tighten the lug nuts to the manufacturerâ€™s specification of 80 ft-lbs.
Final Check

After driving a short distance, re-check the lug nut torque to ensure they remain secure.
