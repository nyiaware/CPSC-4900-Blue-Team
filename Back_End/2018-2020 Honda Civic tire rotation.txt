Preparation

Ensure the car is on a level surface, set the parking brake, and loosen all lug nuts slightly.
Raise the Vehicle

Use a jack to lift one corner at a time and secure it with jack stands.
Remove the Tires

Remove the lug nuts completely and take off the wheels.
Rotation Pattern

For FWD: Move the front tires directly to the rear. Rear tires should cross to the front (rear left to front right and rear right to front left).
Reinstall Tires

Attach the wheels in their new positions, hand-tighten the lug nuts.
Lower and Torque

Lower the car and torque the lug nuts to the manufacturer-recommended 80 ft-lbs.
Inspect and Verify

Check for even tire wear and test drive the vehicle to confirm the tires are securely installed.
