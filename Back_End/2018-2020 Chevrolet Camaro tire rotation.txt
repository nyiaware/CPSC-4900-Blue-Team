Preparation

Park the car on a level surface, engage the parking brake, and loosen the lug nuts on all four tires.
Lift the Vehicle

Jack up the Camaro and secure it with jack stands. Repeat for each side of the vehicle.
Remove Tires

Fully unscrew the lug nuts and remove the tires.
Rotation Pattern

For rear-wheel drive (RWD): The front tires should move to the rear. Rear tires should cross to the front (rear left to front right, rear right to front left).
Reinstall the Tires

Install the wheels in their new positions and hand-tighten the lug nuts.
Lower and Torque

Lower the Camaro and use a torque wrench to tighten the lug nuts to 140 ft-lbs.
Verify

Test drive the car and recheck the lug nut torque after driving for a short distance.
