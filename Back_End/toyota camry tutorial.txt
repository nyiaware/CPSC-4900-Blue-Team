Step-by-Step Instructions for Oil Change on 2020 Toyota Camry
Gather Necessary Tools and Supplies:

Oil (check the Camry manual for type and amount; typically 0W-20 for the 2020 model)
New oil filter
Oil filter wrench
Drain pan
Funnel
Rags and gloves for clean-up
Prepare the Vehicle:

Park on a level surface and engage the parking brake.
Run the engine for a few minutes to warm up the oil (this helps it drain easier).

Lift the Vehicle (if needed):

Use a jack and jack stands or ramps to safely lift the front of the car for easier access to the oil pan.

Drain the Old Oil:

Locate the oil drain plug underneath the engine.
Place the drain pan underneath, then use a wrench to remove the drain plug.
Let the oil completely drain out, then replace the drain plug and tighten securely.

Remove the Old Oil Filter:

Locate the oil filter (usually on the front of the engine).
Use the oil filter wrench to unscrew and remove it. Be cautious of any remaining oil in the filter.

Install the New Oil Filter:

Lubricate the rubber seal of the new oil filter with a little fresh oil.
Screw on the new oil filter by hand until itâ€™s snug, then give it a final turn (do not overtighten).

Add New Oil:

Locate the oil filler cap on the engine.
Use a funnel to pour in the correct amount and type of new oil.
Replace the oil filler cap securely.

Check Oil Level:

Start the engine for a few seconds, then turn it off and wait a minute.
Use the dipstick to check the oil level, topping up if necessary.

Dispose of Old Oil:

Take the used oil and filter to a local recycling center or auto parts store that accepts used oil.
