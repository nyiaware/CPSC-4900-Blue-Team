2018-2020 Honda CR-V
Tools Needed:

Oil filter wrench, drain pan, 17 mm socket wrench, funnel, gloves, new oil filter, and 4.4 quarts of 0W-20 engine oil (verify with the manual).
Prepare the Vehicle

Park on a flat, stable surface. Turn off the engine and let it cool for 15 minutes.
Lift the Car

Use a jack and jack stands to raise the front of the CR-V.
Locate the Drain Plug

The drain plug is on the bottom of the oil pan, toward the center.
Drain the Oil

Place the drain pan under the plug, loosen it with a 17 mm socket wrench, and allow all oil to drain.
Replace the Oil Filter

Unscrew the oil filter (located on the front of the engine) using the oil filter wrench. Coat the rubber gasket on the new filter with fresh oil, then screw it on hand-tight.
Reinstall the Drain Plug

Reattach the drain plug and tighten securely.
Refill with New Oil

Remove the oil cap on the top of the engine and use a funnel to pour in the oil. Check the dipstick for the correct level.
Check for Leaks and Finish

Start the engine and let it run for a minute. Check under the car for leaks. Lower the vehicle and dispose of the used oil responsibly.
