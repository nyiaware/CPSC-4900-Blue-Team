2018-2020 Chevrolet Silverado
Preparation

Ensure the truck is parked on a flat surface, engage the parking brake, and slightly loosen the lug nuts on all four tires using a lug wrench.
Lift the Vehicle

Using a jack, lift the front of the Silverado. Secure it with jack stands. Repeat the process for the rear.
Remove the Tires

Completely unscrew the lug nuts and remove the tires.
Rotation Pattern

For rear-wheel drive (RWD): Front tires move directly to the rear. The rear tires should cross to the front (rear left to front right, rear right to front left).
For four-wheel drive (4WD): The same pattern as above, but ensure the rotation is done across all four tires to maintain balance.
Reinstall the Tires

Place the tires on their new positions and tighten the lug nuts by hand.
Lower and Torque

Lower the vehicle and torque the lug nuts to the manufacturerâ€™s recommended 140 ft-lbs.
Check and Verify

Recheck the torque of the lug nuts after driving for a short distance, ensuring all are secure.
