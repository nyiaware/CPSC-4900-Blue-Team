Instructions:
Prepare the Vehicle:

Park the car on a flat, stable surface and set the parking brake.
Loosen Lug Nuts:

Slightly loosen (but don’t remove) the lug nuts on each wheel with a lug wrench. Do this before lifting the car.

Jack Up the Vehicle:

Use a jack to lift the vehicle one wheel at a time, placing jack stands under the designated lift points for safety.

Remove and Rotate Tires:

Remove each tire and rotate in the recommended pattern:
For front-wheel drive (e.g., many Highlander models): Move the front tires to the back, and the rear tires to the front in a cross pattern.
For rear-wheel drive: Keep the front tires on the same side, and cross the rear tires when moving them to the front.

Install and Tighten Lug Nuts:

Replace each wheel and hand-tighten the lug nuts.

Lower the Vehicle and Torque Lug Nuts:

Lower the car back to the ground and use a torque wrench to tighten each lug nut to the specified torque in the owner’s manual.

Check Tire Pressure:

Adjust each tire’s pressure according to Toyota’s specifications.
