2018-2020 Toyota Camry
Preparation

Park on a level surface and engage the parking brake. Loosen all lug nuts slightly with a lug wrench but do not remove them yet.
Lift the Car

Use a jack to lift the front end and place jack stands under the front pinch welds. Repeat for the rear to elevate the entire car.
Remove Tires

Fully unscrew the lug nuts and remove the tires.
Rotation Pattern

For front-wheel drive (FWD): Move the front tires straight to the back. Cross the rear tires (e.g., rear right to front left and rear left to front right).
Reinstall Tires

Align the tires on the appropriate hubs and tighten the lug nuts by hand.
Lower and Torque

Lower the car from the jack stands and torque the lug nuts to the specified 76 ft-lbs using a torque wrench.
Final Check

Drive a short distance and re-check torque on the lug nuts.
